# Advent Of Code

These are my solutions for Advent of Code challeneges as I find time to do them. I've used Crystal-lang as a chance to learn the compiled ruby-like language.

## Dev Runs

Local runs:

```
crystal 1.cr
```

If runtime is an issue, build a binary with:

```
crystal build 1.cr
./1
```

All days include the test example input and I make a local version with my "real" input from my account in real.txt.


## 01

Simple idea of tracking three sums as you go rather than trying to first create all groups.

## 02

Very straightforward loop with string matching. Looking forward to later challenges.

## 03

Today's challenge was enjoyable. I learned a fast bit conversion in Crystal and I'm starting to get a little understanding of the types and address space.
